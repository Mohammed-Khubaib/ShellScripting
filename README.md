## Getting Started

To begin learning shell scripting:

1. Start with the [Introduction](./basics/intro.md) to understand the basic concepts.
2. Continue with [Flow Control](./basics/control-flow.md) to learn how to make decisions and create loops.
3. Finally, move on to [Functions](./basics/functions.md) to understand how to create reusable code blocks.

## Practice Tips

- Create a dedicated directory for your shell script practice.
- Make your scripts executable with `chmod +x script.sh`.
- Use a simple text editor with syntax highlighting (VS Code, Sublime Text, Vim, etc.).
- Test your scripts in a controlled environment before using them for critical tasks.
- Use shellcheck (https://www.shellcheck.net/) to validate your scripts for common errors and best practices.
